1. How do university rankings change over time?

	Take datasets of different years and compare data between different year

2. Which characteristics of universities contribute most to good rankings, or to large changes in the ranking position?

	Analyse individual criteria and what characteristics contribute to good ranking:

	Number of notable alumni (inventions, prizes, ...) relative to total number of 		students

	Number of alumni in high ranking positions

	Ratios: students and professors, female to male ratio, student to resources (labs, 	computers, ...)

	correlate age of university with rankings?

	budget for conducting research

	research output (how many papers are published per annum?)
	
	
	
	public / private universities
	
	amount of payment
	


3. How do these characteristics correlate with characteristics of cities or countries in which the university is located?

	average out rankings of universities grouped by countries or continents over time 	compare averages
	
	GDP

	HDI
	
	Rain dates per year

	universities per country

	universities per person in a country

	corruptions perception index in a country

	public expenditure


4. Are there predictors for increases or decreases in the rankings?

	Changes in the above mentioned characteristics

Step 1: get the data
- ranking data of universities
- which faculties does a university have
- number of students per study field
- size of city where university lies
- salaries of professors
- tuition fees
- budget for academic education and research of location (per capita)

Step 2: explore the data
- find out about (cor)relations between a variable and the ranking by calculating correlation coefficients, and plotting the data in an appropriate manner

Step 3: model the data
- once possible predictors for increases or decreases of rankings were identified, we should check how the predictors interact with the rankings (start to build up simple machine learning models)
