# uni-ranking

The aim of this project is to analyse, visualise and interpret data regarding university rankings and how changes in the characteristics of the university affect the changes in the rankings. Furthermore, we analyse a couple of factors of the countries the universities are located in, such as HDI and Corruption Perceptions Index to see whether any of such factors influence the rankings.

The project consists of a jupyter notebook structured in data-loading, preprocessing, merging, visualisation and predictive modeling. The notebook is accompanied by a report describing some of the main findings and insights.
